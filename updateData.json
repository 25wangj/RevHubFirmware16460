      "releaseNotes": "## Version 8.1 (20221121-115119)\n\n### Breaking Changes\n* Deprecates the `OpMode` fields `msStuckDetectInit`, `msStuckDetectInitLoop`, `msStuckDetectStart`, `msStuckDetectLoop`, and `msStuckDetectStop`.\n    * Op Modes no longer have a time limit for `init()`, `init_loop()`, `start()` or `loop()`, so the fields corresponding to those methods are no longer used.\n    * `stop()` still has a time limit, but it is now hardcoded to be 1 second, and cannot be changed using `msStuckDetectStop`.\n* Deprecates the `OpMode` methods `internalPreInit()`, `internalPostInitLoop()`, and `internalPostLoop()`.\n    * Iterative `OpMode`s will continue to call these methods in case they were overridden.\n    * These methods will not be called at all for `LinearOpMode`s.\n* Deprecates (and stops respecting) `DeviceProperties.xmlTagAliases`.\n\n### Enhancements\n* Adds a new `IMU` interface to Blocks and Java that can be used with both the original BNO055 IMU\n  included in all older Control Hubs and Expansion Hubs, and the new alternative BHI260AP IMU.\n  * You can determine which type of IMU is in your Control Hub by navigating to the Manage page of the web interface.\n  * To learn how to use the new `IMU` interface, see https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/imu/imu.html. The `SensorIMU` Blocks sample was also updated to use the new `IMU` interface, and the following Java samples were added:\n    * `SensorIMUOrthogonal`\n      * Use this sample if your REV Hub is mounted so that it is parallel or perpendicular to the\n        bottom of your robot.\n    * `SensorIMUNonOrthogonal`\n      * Use this sample if your REV Hub is mounted to your robot in any other orientation\n    * `ConceptExploringIMUOrientations`\n      * This Op Mode is a tool to help you understand how the orthogonal orientations work, and\n        which one applies to your robot.\n  * The BHI260AP IMU can only be accessed via the new `IMU` interface. The BNO055 IMU can be\n    programmed using the new `IMU` interface, or you can continue to program it using the old `BNO055IMU`\n    interface. If you want to be able to quickly switch to a new Control Hub that may contain the\n    BHI260AP IMU, you should migrate your code to use the new `IMU` interface.\n  * Unlike the old `BNO055IMU` interface, which only worked correctly when the REV Hub was mounted flat\n    on your robot, the `IMU` interface allows you to specify the orientation of the REV Hub on your\n    robot. It will account for this, and give you your orientation in a Robot Coordinate System,\n    instead of a special coordinate system for the REV Hub. As a result, your pitch and yaw will be\n    0 when your *robot* is level, instead of when the REV Hub is level, which will result in much\n    more reliable orientation angle values for most mounting orientations.\n  * Because of the new robot-centric coordinate system, the pitch and roll angles returned by the\n    `IMU` interface will be different from the ones returned by the `BNO055IMU` interface. When you are\n    migrating your code, pay careful attention to the documentation.\n  * If you have calibrated your BNO055, you can provide that calibration data to the new `IMU`\n    interface by passing a `BNO055IMUNew.Parameters` instance to `IMU.initialize()`. \n  * The `IMU` interface is also suitable for implementation by third-party vendors for IMUs that\n    support providing the orientation in the form of a quaternion.\n* Iterative `OpMode`s (as opposed to `LinearOpMode`s) now run on a dedicated thread.\n    * Cycle times should not be as impacted by everything else going on in the system.\n    * Slow `OpMode`s can no longer increase the amount of time it takes to process network commands, and vice versa.\n    * The `init()`, `init_loop()`, `start()` and `loop()` methods no longer need to return within a certain time frame.\n* BNO055 IMU legacy driver: restores the ability to initialize in one Op Mode, and then have another Op Mode re-use that\n  initialization. This allows you to maintain the 0-yaw position between Op Modes, if desired.\n* Allows customized versions of device drivers in the FTC SDK to use the same XML tag.\n  * Before, if you wanted to customize a device driver, you had to copy it to a new class _and_ give\n    it a new XML tag. Giving it a new XML tag meant that to switch which driver was being used, you\n    had to modify your configuration file.\n  * Now, to use your custom driver, all you have to do is specify your custom driver's class when\n    calling `hardwareMap.get()`. To go back to the original driver, specify the original driver\n    class. If you specify an interface that is implemented by both the original driver and the\n    custom driver, there is no guarantee about which implementation will be returned.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n* Fixes accessing the \"Manage TensorFlow Lite Models\" and \"Manage Sounds\" links and performing\n  Blocks and OnBotJava Op Mode downloads from the REV Hardware Client.\n* Fixes issue where an I2C device driver would be auto-initialized using the parameters assigned in\n  a previous Op Mode run.\n* Improves Driver Station popup menu placement in the landscape layout.\n* Fixes NullPointerException when attempting to get a non-configured BNO055 IMU in a Blocks Op Mode on an RC phone.\n* Fixes problem with Blocks if a variable is named `orientation`.",

Support remains for Modern Robotics I2C sensors.\n\n### Enhancements\n* Increases the height of the 3-dots Landscape menu touch area on the Driver Station, making it much easier to select.\n* Adds `terminateOpModeNow()` method to allow OpModes to cleanly self-exit immediately.\n* Adds `opModeInInit()` method to `LinearOpMode` to facilitate init-loops. Similar to `opModeIsActive()` but for the init phase.\n* Warns user if they have a Logitech F310 gamepad connected that is set to DirectInput mode.\n* Allows SPARKmini motor controllers to react more quickly to speed changes.\n* Hides the version number of incorrectly installed sister app (i.e. DS installed on RC device or vice-versa) on inspection screen.\n* Adds support for allowing the user to edit the comment for the runOpMode block.\n* Adds parameterDefaultValues field to @ExportToBlocks.

      "releaseNotes": "## Version 6.0 (20200921-085816)\n\n### Important Notes\n* Version 6.0 is the minimum legal version for the Ultimate Goal season.\n* Version 5.5 was a moderately large off-season, August 2020, drop.  It's worth reviewing those release notes below also.\n* Version 5.5 and greater will not work on older Android 4.x and 5.x phones.  Users must upgrade to an approved Android 6.x device or newer.\n* The default PIDF values for REV motors have been reverted to the default PID values that were used in the 2018-2019 season\n    * This change was made because the 2018-2019 values turned out to work better for many mechanisms\n    * This brings the behavior of the REV motors in line with the behavior of all other motors\n    * If you prefer the 2019-2020 season's behavior for REV motors, here are the PIDF values that were in place, so that you can manually set them in your OpModes:  \n      <br>\n      **HD Hex motors (all gearboxes):**  \n      Velocity PIDF values: `P = 1.17`, `I = 0.117`, `F = 11.7`  \n      Position PIDF values: `P = 5.0`  \n      **Core Hex motor:**  \n      Velocity PIDF values: `P = 4.96`, `I = 0.496`, `F = 49.6`  \n      Position PIDF values: `P = 5.0`\n\n### New features\n* Includes TensorFlow inference model and sample op modes to detect Ultimate Goal Starter Stacks (four rings vs single ring stack).\n* Includes Vuforia Ultimate Goal vision targets and sample op modes.\n* Introduces a digital zoom feature for TensorFlow object detection (to detect objects more accurately at greater distances).\n* Adds configuration entry for the REV UltraPlanetary HD Hex motor\n\n### Enhancements\n* Adds setGain() and getGain() methods to the NormalizedColorSensor interface\n    * By setting the gain of a color sensor, you can adjust for different lighting conditions.\n      For example, if you detect lower color values than expected, you can increase the gain.\n    * The gain value is only applied to the argb() and getNormalizedColors() methods, not to the raw color methods.\n      The getNormalizedColors() method is recommended for ease-of-use and clarity, since argb() has to be converted.\n    * Updates SensorColor Java sample to demonstrate gain usage\n* Merges SensorREVColorDistance Java sample into SensorColor Java sample, which showcases best practices for all color sensors\n* Improves retrieving values from the REV Color Sensor V3\n    * Updates the normalization calculation of the RGB channels\n    * Improves the calculation of the alpha channel (can be used as an overall brightness indicator)\n    * Fixes the default sensor resolution, which caused issues with bright environments\n    * Adds support for changing the resolution and measuring rate of the Broadcom sensor chip\n    * Removes IR readings and calculations not meant for the Broadcom sensor chip\n\n### Bug fixes\n* Improved reliability of BNO055IMU IMU initialization to prevent random initialization failures (which manifested as `Problem with 'imu'`).\n\n## Version 5.5 (20200824-090813)\n\n### New features\n* Adds support for calling custom Java classes from Blocks OpModes (fixes [SkyStone issue #161](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SkyStone/issues/161)).\n    * Classes must be in the org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode package.\n    * Methods must be public static and have no more than 21 parameters.\n    * Parameters declared as OpMode, LinearOpMode, Telemetry, and HardwareMap are supported and the\n      argument is provided automatically, regardless of the order of the parameters. On the block,\n      the sockets for those parameters are automatically filled in.\n    * Parameters declared as char or java.lang.Character will accept any block that returns text\n      and will only use the first character in the text.\n    * Parameters declared as boolean or java.lang.Boolean will accept any block that returns boolean.\n    * Parameters declared as byte, java.lang.Byte, short, java.lang.Short, int, java.lang.Integer,\n      long, or java.lang.Long,  will accept any block that returns a number and will round that\n      value to the nearest whole number.\n    * Parameters declared as float, java.lang.Float, double, java.lang.Double will accept any\n      block that returns a number.\n* Adds telemetry API method for setting display format\n    * Classic\n    * Monospace\n    * HTML (certain tags only)\n* Adds blocks support for switching cameras.\n* Adds Blocks support for TensorFlow Object Detection with a custom model.\n* Adds support for uploading a custom TensorFlow Object Detection model in the Manage page, which\n  is especially useful for Blocks and OnBotJava users.\n* Shows new Control Hub blink codes when the WiFi band is switched using the Control Hub's button (only possible on Control Hub OS 1.1.2)\n* Adds new warnings which can be disabled in the Advanced RC Settings\n    * Mismatched app versions warning\n    * Unnecessary 2.4 GHz WiFi usage warning\n    * REV Hub is running outdated firmware (older than version 1.8.2)\n* Adds support for Sony PS4 gamepad, and reworks how gamepads work on the Driver Station\n    * Removes preference which sets gamepad type based on driver position. Replaced with menu which allows specifying type for gamepads with unknown VID and PID\n    * Attempts to auto-detect gamepad type based on USB VID and PID\n    * If gamepad VID and PID is not known, use type specified by user for that VID and PID\n    * If gamepad VID and PID is not known AND the user has not specified a type for that VID and PID, an educated guess is made about how to map the gamepad\n* Driver Station will now attempt to automatically recover from a gamepad disconnecting, and re-assign it to the position it was assigned to when it dropped\n    * If only one gamepad is assigned and it drops: it can be recovered\n    * If two gamepads are assigned, and have **different** VID/PID signatures, and only one drops: it will be recovered\n    * If two gamepads are assigned, and have **different** VID/PID signatures, and BOTH drop: both will be recovered\n    * If two gamepads are assigned, and have **the same** VID/PID signatures, and only one drops: it will be recovered\n    * If two gamepads are assigned, and have **the same** VID/PID signatures, and BOTH drop: **neither** will be recovered, because of the ambiguity of the gamepads when they re-appear on the USB bus.\n    * There is currently one known edge case: if there are **two** gamepads with **the same** VID/PID signature plugged in, **but only one is assigned**, and they BOTH drop, it's a 50-50 chance of which one will be chosen for automatic recovery to the assigned position: it is determined by whichever one is re-enumerated first by the USB bus controller.\n* Adds landscape user interface to Driver Station\n    * New feature: practice timer with audio cues\n    * New feature (Control Hub only): wireless network connection strength indicator (0-5 bars)\n    * New feature (Control Hub only): tapping on the ping/channel display will switch to an alternate display showing radio RX dBm and link speed (tap again to switch back)\n    * The layout will NOT autorotate. You can switch the layout from the Driver Station's settings menu.\n\n### Breaking changes\n* Removes support for Android versions 4.4 through 5.1 (KitKat and Lollipop). The minSdkVersion is now 23.\n* Removes the deprecated `LinearOpMode` methods `waitOneFullHardwareCycle()` and `waitForNextHardwareCycle()`\n\n### Enhancements\n* Handles RS485 address of Control Hub automatically\n    * The Control Hub is automatically given a reserved address\n    * Existing configuration files will continue to work\n    * All addresses in the range of 1-10 are still available for Expansion Hubs\n    * The Control Hub light will now normally be solid green, without blinking to indicate the address\n    * The Control Hub will not be shown on the Expansion Hub Address Change settings page\n* Improves REV Hub firmware updater\n    * The user can now choose between all available firmware update files\n    * Version 1.8.2 of the REV Hub firmware is bundled into the Robot Controller app.\n    * Text was added to clarify that Expansion Hubs can only be updated via USB.\n    * Firmware update speed was reduced to improve reliability\n    * Allows REV Hub firmware to be updated directly from the Manage webpage\n* Improves log viewer on Robot Controller\n    * Horizontal scrolling support (no longer word wrapped)\n    * Supports pinch-to-zoom\n    * Uses a monospaced font\n    * Error messages are highlighted\n    * New color scheme\n* Attempts to force-stop a runaway/stuck OpMode without restarting the entire app\n    * Not all types of runaway conditions are stoppable, but if the user code attempts to talk to hardware during the runaway, the system should be able to capture it.\n* Makes various tweaks to the Self Inspect screen\n    * Renames \"OS version\" entry to \"Android version\"\n    * Renames \"WiFi Direct Name\" to \"WiFi Name\"\n    * Adds Control Hub OS version, when viewing the report of a Control Hub\n    * Hides the airplane mode entry, when viewing the report of a Control Hub\n    * Removes check for ZTE Speed Channel Changer\n    * Shows firmware version for **all** Expansion and Control Hubs\n* Reworks network settings portion of Manage page\n    * All network settings are now applied with a single click\n    * The WiFi Direct channel of phone-based Robot Controllers can now be changed from the Manage page\n    * WiFi channels are filtered by band (2.4 vs 5 GHz) and whether they overlap with other channels\n    * The current WiFi channel is pre-selected on phone-based Robot Controllers, and Control Hubs running OS 1.1.2 or later.\n    * On Control Hubs running OS 1.1.2 or later, you can choose to have the system automatically select a channel on the 5 GHz band\n* Improves OnBotJava\n    * New light and dark themes replace the old themes (chaos, github, chrome,...)\n        * the new default theme is `light` and will be used when you first update to this version\n    * OnBotJava now has a tabbed editor\n    * Read-only offline mode\n* Improves function of \"exit\" menu item on Robot Controller and Driver Station\n    * Now guaranteed to be fully stopped and unloaded from memory\n* Shows a warning message if a LinearOpMode exists prematurely due to failure to monitor for the start condition\n* Improves error message shown when the Driver Station and Robot Controller are incompatible with each other\n* Driver Station OpMode Control Panel now disabled while a Restart Robot is in progress\n* Disables advanced settings related to WiFi direct when the Robot Controller is a Control Hub.\n* Tint phone battery icons on Driver Station when low/critical.\n* Uses names \"Control Hub Portal\" and \"Control Hub\" (when appropriate) in new configuration files\n* Improve I2C read performance\n    * Very large improvement on Control Hub; up to ~2x faster with small (e.g. 6 byte) reads\n    * Not as apparent on Expansion Hubs connected to a phone\n* Update/refresh build infrastructure\n    * Update to 'androidx' support library from 'com.android.support:appcompat', which is end-of-life\n    * Update targetSdkVersion and compileSdkVersion to 28\n    * Update Android Studio's Android plugin to latest\n    * Fix reported build timestamp in 'About' screen\n* Add sample illustrating manual webcam use: ConceptWebcam\n\n\n### Bug fixes\n* Fixes [SkyStone issue #248](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SkyStone/issues/248)\n* Fixes [SkyStone issue #232](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SkyStone/issues/232) and\n  modifies bulk caching semantics to allow for cache-preserving MANUAL/AUTO transitions.\n* Improves performance when REV 2M distance sensor is unplugged\n* Improves readability of Toast messages on certain devices\n* Allows a Driver Station to connect to a Robot Controller after another has disconnected\n* Improves generation of fake serial numbers for UVC cameras which do not provide a real serial number\n    * Previously some devices would assign such cameras a serial of `0:0` and fail to open and start streaming\n    * Fixes [ftc_app issue #638](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/issues/638).\n* Fixes a slew of bugs with the Vuforia camera monitor including:\n    * Fixes bug where preview could be displayed with a wonky aspect ratio\n    * Fixes bug where preview could be cut off in landscape\n    * Fixes bug where preview got totally messed up when rotating phone\n    * Fixes bug where crosshair could drift off target when using webcams\n* Fixes issue in UVC driver on some devices ([ftc_app 681](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/issues/681)) if streaming was started/stopped multiple times in a row\n    * Issue manifested as kernel panic on devices which do not have [this kernel patch](https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/352400/).\n    * On affected devices which **do** have the patch, the issue was manifest as simply a failure to start streaming.\n    * The Tech Team believes that the root cause of the issue is a bug in the Linux kernel XHCI driver. A workaround was implemented in the SDK UVC driver.\n* Fixes bug in UVC driver where often half the frames from the camera would be dropped (e.g. only 15FPS delivered during a streaming session configured for 30FPS).\n* Fixes issue where TensorFlow Object Detection would show results whose confidence was lower than\n  the minimum confidence parameter.\n* Fixes a potential exploitation issue of [CVE-2019-11358](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2019-11358/) in OnBotJava\n* Fixes changing the address of an Expansion Hub with additional Expansion Hubs connected to it\n* Preserves the Control Hub's network connection when \"Restart Robot\" is selected\n* Fixes issue where device scans would fail while the Robot was restarting\n* Fix RenderScript usage\n    * Use androidx.renderscript variant: increased compatibility\n    * Use RenderScript in Java mode, not native: simplifies build\n* Fixes webcam-frame-to-bitmap conversion problem: alpha channel wasn't being initialized, only R, G, & B\n* Fixes possible arithmetic overflow in Deadline\n* Fixes deadlock in Vuforia webcam support which could cause 5-second delays when stopping OpMode\n\n## Version 5.4 (20200108-101156)\n* Fixes [SkyStone issue #88](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SkyStone/issues/88)\n* Adds an inspection item that notes when a robot controller (Control Hub) is using the factory default password.\n* Fixes [SkyStone issue #61](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SkyStone/issues/61)\n* Fixes [SkyStone issue #142](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SkyStone/issues/142)\n* Fixes [ftc_app issue #417](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/issues/417) by adding more current and voltage monitoring capabilities for REV Hubs.\n* Fixes [a crash sometimes caused by OnBotJava activity](https://ftcforum.firstinspires.org/forum/ftc-technology/76217-onbotjava-crashes-robot-controller)\n* Improves OnBotJava autosave functionality [ftc_app #738](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/issues/738)\n* Fixes system responsiveness issue when an Expansion Hub is disconnected\n* Fixes issue where IMU initialization could prevent Op Modes from stopping\n* Fixes issue where AndroidTextToSpeech.speak() would fail if it was called too early\n* Adds telemetry.speak() methods and blocks, which cause the Driver Station (if also updated) to speak text\n* Adds and improves Expansion Hub-related warnings\n    * Improves Expansion Hub low battery warning\n        * Displays the warning immediately after the hub reports it\n        * Specifies whether the condition is current or occurred temporarily during an OpMode run\n        * Displays which hubs reported low battery\n    * Displays warning when hub loses and regains power during an OpMode run\n        * Fixes the hub's LED pattern after this condition\n    * Displays warning when Expansion Hub is not responding to commands\n        * Specifies whether the condition is current or occurred temporarily during an OpMode run\n    * Clarifies warning when Expansion Hub is not present at startup\n        * Specifies that this condition requires a Robot Restart before the hub can be used.\n        * The hub light will now accurately reflect this state\n    * Improves logging and reduces log spam during these conditions\n* Syncs the Control Hub time and timezone to a connected web browser programming the robot, if a Driver Station is not available.\n* Adds bulk read functionality for REV Hubs\n  * A bulk caching mode must be set at the Hub level with `LynxModule#setBulkCachingMode()`. This applies to all relevant SDK hardware classes that reference that Hub.\n  * The following following Hub bulk caching modes are available:\n    * `BulkCachingMode.OFF` (default): All hardware calls operate as usual. Bulk data can read through `LynxModule#getBulkData()` and processed manually.\n    * `BulkCachingMode.AUTO`: Applicable hardware calls are served from a bulk read cache that is cleared/refreshed automatically to ensure identical commands don't hit the same cache. The cache can also be cleared manually with `LynxModule#clearBulkCache()`, although this is not recommended.\n    * (advanced users) `BulkCachingMode.MANUAL`: Same as `BulkCachingMode.AUTO` except the cache is never cleared automatically. To avoid getting stale data, the cache must be manually cleared at the beginning of each loop body or as the user deems appropriate.\n* Removes PIDF Annotation values added in Rev 5.3 (to AndyMark, goBILDA and TETRIX motor configurations).\n  * The new motor types will still be available but their Default control behavior will revert back to Rev 5.2\n* Adds new `ConceptMotorBulkRead` sample Opmode to demonstrate and compare Motor Bulk-Read modes for reducing I/O latencies.\n\n## Version 5.3 (20191004-112306)\n* Fixes external USB/UVC webcam support\n* Makes various bugfixes and improvements to Blocks page, including but not limited to:\n    * Many visual tweaks\n    * Browser zoom and window resize behave better\n    * Resizing the Java preview pane works better and more consistently across browsers\n    * The Java preview pane consistently gets scrollbars when needed\n    * The Java preview pane is hidden by default on phones\n    * Internet Explorer 11 should work\n    * Large dropdown lists display properly on lower res screens\n    * Disabled buttons are now visually identifiable as disabled\n    * A warning is shown if a user selects a TFOD sample, but their device is not compatible\n    * Warning messages in a Blocks op mode are now visible by default.\n* Adds goBILDA 5201 and 5202 motors to Robot Configurator\n* Adds PIDF Annotation values to AndyMark, goBILDA and TETRIX motor configurations.\n    This has the effect of causing the RUN_USING_ENCODERS and RUN_TO_POSITION modes to use\n    PIDF vs PID closed loop control on these motors.  This should provide more responsive, yet stable, speed control.\n    PIDF adds Feedforward control to the basic PID control loop.\n    Feedforward is useful when controlling a motor's speed because it \"anticipates\" how much the control voltage\n    must change to achieve a new speed set-point, rather than requiring the integrated error to change sufficiently.\n    The PIDF values were chosen to provide responsive, yet stable, speed control on a lightly loaded motor.\n    The more heavily a motor is loaded (drag or friction), the more noticable the PIDF improvement will be.\n* Fixes startup crash on Android 10\n* Fixes [ftc_app issue #712](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/issues/712) (thanks to FROGbots-4634)\n* Fixes [ftc_app issue #542](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/issues/542)\n* Allows \"A\" and lowercase letters when naming device through RC and DS apps.\n\n## Version 5.2 (20190905-083277)\n* Fixes extra-wide margins on settings activities, and placement of the new configuration button\n* Adds Skystone Vuforia image target data.\n   * Includes sample Skystone Vuforia Navigation op modes (Java).\n   * Includes sample Skystone Vuforia Navigation op modes (Blocks).\n* Adds TensorFlow inference model (.tflite) for Skystone game elements.\n   * Includes sample Skystone TensorFlow op modes (Java).\n   * Includes sample Skystone TensorFlow op modes (Blocks).\n* Removes older (season-specific) sample op modes.\n* Includes 64-bit support (to comply with [Google Play requirements](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/01/get-your-apps-ready-for-64-bit.html)).\n* Protects against Stuck OpModes when a Restart Robot is requested. (Thanks to FROGbots-4634) ([ftc_app issue #709](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/issues/709))\n* Blocks related changes:\n   * Fixes bug with blocks generated code when hardware device name is a java or javascript reserved word.\n   * Shows generated java code for blocks, even when hardware items are missing from the active configuration.\n   * Displays warning icon when outdated Vuforia and TensorFlow blocks are used ([SkyStone issue #27](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SkyStone/issues/27))\n\n## Version 5.1 (20190820-222104)\n* Defines default PIDF parameters for the following motors:\n    * REV Core Hex Motor\n    * REV 20:1 HD Hex Motor\n    * REV 40:1 HD Hex Motor\n* Adds back button when running on a device without a system back button (such as a Control Hub)\n* Allows a REV Control Hub to update the firmware on a REV Expansion Hub via USB\n* Fixes [SkyStone issue #9](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SkyStone/issues/9)\n* Fixes [ftc_app issue #715](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/issues/715)\n* Prevents extra DS User clicks by filtering based on current state.\n* Prevents incorrect DS UI state changes when receiving new OpMode list from RC\n* Adds support for REV Color Sensor V3\n* Adds a manual-refresh DS Camera Stream for remotely viewing RC camera frames.\n    * To show the stream on the DS, initialize **but do not run** a stream-enabled opmode, select the Camera Stream option in the DS menu, and tap the image to refresh. This feature is automatically enabled when using Vuforia or TFOD no additional RC configuration is required for typical use cases. To hide the stream, select the same menu item again.\n    * Note that gamepads are disabled and the selected opmode cannot be started while the stream is open as a safety precaution.\n    * To use custom streams, consult the API docs for `CameraStreamServer#setSource` and `CameraStreamSource`.\n* Adds many Star Wars sounds to RobotController resources.\n* Added Skystone Sounds Chooser Sample Program.\n* Switches out startup, connect chimes, and error/warning sounds for Star Wars sounds\n* Updates OnBot Java to use a WebSocket for communication with the robot\n    * The OnBot Java page no longer has to do a full refresh when a user switches from editing one file to another\n\nKnown issues:\n* Camera Stream\n    * The Vuforia camera stream inherits the issues present in the phone preview (namely [ftc_app issue #574](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/issues/574)). This problem does not affect the TFOD camera stream even though it receives frames from Vuforia.\n    * The orientation of the stream frames may not always match the phone preview. For now, these frames may be rotated manually via a custom `CameraStreamSource` if desired.\n* OnBotJava\n    * Browser back button may not always work correctly\n    * It's possible for a build to be queued, but not started. The OnBot Java build console will display a warning if this occurs.\n    * A user might not realize they are editing a different file if the user inadvertently switches from one file to another since this switch is now seamless. The name of the currently open file is displayed in the browser tab.\n\n## Version 5.0 (built on 19.06.14)\n * Support for the REV Robotics Control Hub.\n * Adds a Java preview pane to the Blocks editor.\n * Adds a new offline export feature to the Blocks editor.\n * Display wifi channel in Network circle on Driver Station.\n * Adds calibration for Logitech C270\n * Updates build tooling and target SDK.\n * Compliance with Google's permissions infrastructure (Required after build tooling update).\n * Keep Alives to mitigate the Motorola wifi scanning problem.  Telemetry substitute no longer necessary.\n * Improves Vuforia error reporting.\n * Fixes ftctechnh/ftc_app issues 621, 713.\n * Miscellaneous bug fixes and improvements.\n\n## Version 4.3 (built on 18.10.31)\n * Includes missing TensorFlow-related libraries and files.\n\n## Version 4.2 (built on 18.10.30)\n * Includes fix to avoid deadlock situation with WatchdogMonitor which could result in USB communication errors.\n     - Comm error appeared to require that user disconnect USB cable and restart the Robot Controller app to recover.\n     - robotControllerLog.txt would have error messages that included the words \"E RobotCore: lynx xmit lock: #### abandoning lock:\"\n * Includes fix to correctly list the parent module address for a REV Robotics Expansion Hub in a configuration (.xml) file.\n     - Bug in versions 4.0 and 4.1 would incorrect list the address module for a parent REV Robotics device as \"1\".\n     - If the parent module had a higher address value than the daisy-chained module, then this bug would prevent the Robot Controller from communicating with the downstream Expansion Hub.\n * Added requirement for ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION to allow a Driver Station running Android Oreo to scan for Wi-Fi Direct devices.\n * Added google() repo to build.gradle because aapt2 must be downloaded from the google() repository beginning with version 3.2 of the Android Gradle Plugin.\n     - Important Note: Android Studio users will need to be connected to the Internet the first time build the ftc_app project.\n     - Internet connectivity is required for the first build so the appropriate files can be downloaded from the Google repository.\n     - Users should not need to be connected to the Internet for subsequent builds.\n     - This should also fix buid issue where Android Studio would complain that it \"Could not find com.android.tools.lint:lint-gradle:26.1.4\" (or similar).\n * Added support for REV Spark Mini motor controller as part of the configuration menu for a servo/PWM port on the REV Expansion Hub.\n * Provide examples for playing audio files in an Op Mode.\n * Block Development Tool Changes\n     - Includes a fix for a problem with the Velocity blocks that were reported in the FTC Technology forum (Blocks Programming subforum).\n     - Change the \"Save completed successfully.\" message to a white color so it will contrast with a green background.\n     - Fixed the \"Download image\" feature so it will work if there are text blocks in the op mode.\n * Introduce support for Google's TensorFlow Lite technology for object detetion for 2018-2019 game.\n     - TensorFlow lite can recognize Gold Mineral and Silver Mineral from 2018-2019 game.\n     - Example Java and Block op modes are included to show how to determine the relative position of the gold block (left, center, right).\n\n## Version 4.1 (released on 18.09.24)\n\nChanges include:\n * Fix to prevent crash when deprecated configuration annotations are used.\n * Change to allow FTC Robot Controller APK to be auto-updated using FIRST Global Control Hub update scripts.\n * Removed samples for non supported / non legal hardware.\n * Improvements to Telemetry.addData block with \"text\" socket.\n * Updated Blocks sample op mode list to include Rover Ruckus Vuforia example.\n * Update SDK library version number.\n\n## Version 4.0 (released on 18.09.12)\n\nChanges include:\n * Initial support for UVC compatible cameras\n    - If UVC camera has a unique serial number, RC will detect and enumerate by serial number.\n    - If UVC camera lacks a unique serial number, RC will only support one camera of that type connected.\n    - Calibration settings for a few cameras are included (see TeamCode/src/main/res/xml/teamwebcamcalibrations.xml for details).\n    - User can upload calibration files from Program and Manage web interface.\n    - UVC cameras seem to draw a fair amount of electrical current from the USB bus.\n         + This does not appear to present any problems for the REV Robotics Control Hub.\n\t + This does seem to create stability problems when using some cameras with an Android phone-based Robot Controller.\n\t + FTC Tech Team is investigating options to mitigate this issue with the phone-based Robot Controllers.\n    - Updated sample Vuforia Navigation and VuMark Op Modes to demonstrate how to use an internal phone-based camera and an external UVC webcam.\n\n * Support for improved motor control.\n    - REV Robotics Expansion Hub firmware 1.8 and greater will support a feed forward mechanism for closed loop motor control.\n    - FTC SDK has been modified to support PIDF coefficients (proportional, integral, derivative, and feed forward).\n    - FTC Blocks development tool modified to include PIDF programming blocks.\n    - Deprecated older PID-related methods and variables.\n    - REV's 1.8.x PIDF-related changes provide a more linear and accurate way to control a motor.\n\n * Wireless\n    - Added 5GHz support for wireless channel changing for those devices that support it.\n        + Tested with Moto G5 and E4 phones.\n\t+ Also tested with other (currently non-approved) phones such as Samsung Galaxy S8.\n\n* Improved Expansion Hub firmware update support in Robot Controller app\n    - Changes to make the system more robust during the firmware update process (when performed through Robot Controller app).\n    - User no longer has to disconnect a downstream daisy-chained Expansion Hub when updating an Expansion Hub's firmware.\n        + If user is updating an Expansion Hub's firmware through a USB connection, he/she does not have to disconnect RS485 connection to other Expansion Hubs.\n\t+ The user still must use a USB connection to update an Expansion Hub's firmware.\n\t+ The user cannot update the Expansion Hub firmware for a downstream device that is daisy chained through an RS485 connection.\n    - If an Expansion Hub accidentally gets \"bricked\" the Robot Controller app is now more likely to recognize the Hub when it scans the USB bus.\n        + Robot Controller app should be able to detect an Expansion Hub, even if it accidentally was bricked in a previous update attempt.\n\t+ Robot Controller app should be able to install the firmware onto the Hub, even if if accidentally was bricked in a previous update attempt.\n\n * Resiliency\n    - FTC software can detect and enable an FTDI reset feature that is available with REV Robotics v1.8 Expansion Hub firmware and greater.\n        + When enabled, the Expansion Hub can detect if it hasn't communicated with the Robot Controller over the FTDI (USB) connection.\n\t+ If the Hub hasn't heard from the Robot Controller in a while, it will reset the FTDI connection.\n\t+ This action helps system recover from some ESD-induced disruptions.\n    - Various fixes to improve reliability of FTC software.\n\n * Blocks\n    - Fixed errors with string and list indices in blocks export to java.\n    - Support for USB connected UVC webcams.\n    - Refactored optimized Blocks Vuforia code to support Rover Ruckus image targets.\n    - Added programming blocks to support PIDF (proportional, integral, derivative and feed forward) motor control.\n    - Added formatting options (under Telemetry and Miscellaneous categories) so user can set how many decimal places to display a numerical value.\n    - Support to play audio files (which are uploaded through Blocks web interface) on Driver Station in addition to the Robot Controller.\n    - Fixed bug with Download Image of Blocks feature.\n    - Support for REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller.\n    - Support for REV Robotics 2m Distance Sensor.\n    - Added support for a REV Touch Sensor (no longer have to configure as a generic digital device).\n    - Added blocks for DcMotorEx methods.\n        + These are enhanced methods that you can use when supported by the motor controller hardware.\n\t+ The REV Robotics Expansion Hub supports these enhanced methods.\n\t+ Enhanced methods include methods to get/set motor velocity (in encoder pulses per second), get/set PIDF coefficients, etc..\n\n * Modest Improvements in Logging\n    - Decrease frequency of battery checker voltage statements.\n    - Removed non-FTC related log statements (wherever possible).\n    - Introduced a \"Match Logging\" feature.\n        + Under \"Settings\" a user can enable/disable this feature (it's disabled by default).\n\t+ If enabled, user provides a \"Match Number\" through the Driver Station user interface (top of the screen).\n\t    * The Match Number is used to create a log file specifically with log statements from that particular Op Mode run.\n\t    * Match log files are stored in /sdcard/FIRST/matlogs on the Robot Controller.\n\t    * Once an op mode run is complete, the Match Number is cleared.\n\t    * This is a convenient way to create a separate match log with statements only related to a specific op mode run.\n\n * New Devices\n    - Support for REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller.\n    - Support for REV Robotics 2m Distance Sensor.\n    - Added configuration option for REV 20:1 HD Hex Motor.\n    - Added support for a REV Touch Sensor (no longer have to configure as a generic digital device).\n\n * Miscellaneous\n    - Fixed some errors in the definitions for acceleration and velocity in our javadoc documentation.\n    - Added ability to play audio files on Driver Station\n    - When user is configuring an Expansion Hub, the LED on the Expansion Hub will change blink pattern (purple-cyan)  to indicate which Hub is currently being configured.\n    - Renamed I2cSensorType to I2cDeviceType.\n    - Added an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates localization using 2018-2019 (Rover Ruckus presented by QualComm) Vuforia targets.\n    - Added an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates how to use the REV Robotics 2m Laser Distance Sensor.\n    - Added an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates how to use the REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller.\n    - Re-categorized external Java sample Op Modes to \"TeleOp\" instead of \"Autonomous\".\n\nKnown issues:\n * Initial support for UVC compatible cameras\n    - UVC cameras seem to draw significant amount of current from the USB bus.\n        + This does not appear to present any problems for the REV Robotics Control Hub.\n\t+ This does seem to create stability problems when using some cameras with an Android phone-based Robot Controller.\n\t+ FTC Tech Team is investigating options to mitigate this issue with the phone-based Robot Controllers.\n    - There might be a possible deadlock which causes the RC to become unresponsive when using a UVC webcam with a Nougat Android Robot Controller.\n\n * Wireless\n    - When user selects a wireless channel, this channel does not necessarily persist if the phone is power cycled.\n        + Tech Team is hoping to eventually address this issue in a future release.\n\t+ Issue has been present since apps were introduced (i.e., it is not new with the v4.0 release).\n    - Wireless channel is not currently displayed for WiFi Direct connections.\n\n * Miscellaneous\n    - The blink indication feature that shows which Expansion Hub is currently being configured does not work for a newly created configuration file.\n        + User has to first save a newly created configuration file and then close and re-edit the file in order for blink indicator to work.\n\n## Version 3.6 (built on 17.12.18)\n\nChanges include:\n * Blocks Changes\n     - Uses updated Google Blockly software to allow users to edit their op modes on Apple iOS devices (including iPad and iPhone).\n     - Improvement in Blocks tool to handle corrupt op mode files.\n     - Autonomous op modes should no longer get switched back to tele-op after re-opening them to be edited.\n     - The system can now detect type mismatches during runtime and alert the user with a message on the Driver Station.\n * Updated javadoc documentation for setPower() method to reflect correct range of values (-1 to +1).\n * Modified VuforiaLocalizerImpl to allow for user rendering of frames\n     - Added a user-overrideable onRenderFrame() method which gets called by the class's renderFrame() method.\n\n## Version 3.5 (built on 17.10.30)\n\nChanges with version 3.5 include:\n * Introduced a fix to prevent random op mode stops, which can occur after the Robot Controller app has been paused and then resumed (for example, when a user temporarily turns off the display of the Robot Controller phone, and then turns the screen back on).\n * Introduced a fix to prevent random op mode stops, which were previously caused by random peer disconnect events on the Driver Station.\n * Fixes issue where log files would be closed on pause of the RC or DS, but not re-opened upon resume.\n * Fixes issue with battery handler (voltage) start/stop race.\n * Fixes issue where Android Studio generated op modes would disappear from available list in certain situations.\n * Fixes problem where OnBot Java would not build on REV Robotics Control Hub.\n * Fixes problem where OnBot Java would not build if the date and time on the Robot Controller device was \"rewound\" (set to an earlier date/time).\n * Improved error message on OnBot Java that occurs when renaming a file fails.\n * Removed unneeded resources from android.jar binaries used by OnBot Java to reduce final size of Robot Controller app.\n * Added MR_ANALOG_TOUCH_SENSOR block to Blocks Programming Tool.\n\n## Version 3.4 (built on 17.09.06)\n\nChanges with version 3.4 include:\n * Added telemetry.update() statement for BlankLinearOpMode template.\n * Renamed sample Block op modes to be more consistent with Java samples.\n * Added some additional sample Block op modes.\n * Reworded OnBot Java readme slightly.\n\n## Version 3.3 (built on 17.09.04)\n\nThis version of the software includes improves for the FTC Blocks Programming Tool and the OnBot Java Programming Tool.\n\nChanges with verion 3.3 include:\n * Android Studio ftc_app project has been updated to use Gradle Plugin 2.3.3.\n * Android Studio ftc_app project is already using gradle 3.5 distribution.\n * Robot Controller log has been renamed to /sdcard/RobotControllerLog.txt (note that this change was actually introduced w/ v3.2).\n * Improvements in I2C reliability.\n * Optimized I2C read for REV Expansion Hub, with v1.7 firmware or greater.\n * Updated all external/samples (available through OnBot and in Android project folder).\n * Vuforia\n    - Added support for VuMarks that will be used for the 2017-2018 season game.\n * Blocks\n    - Update to latest Google Blockly release.\n    - Sample op modes can be selected as a template when creating new op mode.\n    - Fixed bug where the blocks would disappear temporarily when mouse button is held down.\n    - Added blocks for Range.clip and Range.scale.\n    - User can now disable/enable Block op modes.\n    - Fix to prevent occasional Blocks deadlock.\n * OnBot Java\n    - Significant improvements with autocomplete function for OnBot Java editor.\n    - Sample op modes can be selected as a template when creating new op mode.\n    - Fixes and changes to complete hardware setup feature.\n    - Updated (and more useful) onBot welcome message.\n\nKnown issues:\n * Android Studio\n    - After updating to the new v3.3 Android Studio project folder, if you get error messages indicating \"InvalidVirtualFileAccessException\" then you might need to do a File->Invalidate Caches / Restart to clear the error.\n * OnBot Java\n    - Sometimes when you push the build button to build all op modes, the RC returns an error message that the build failed.  If you press the build button a second time, the build typically suceeds.\n\n## Version 3.2 (built on 17.08.02)\n\nThis version of the software introduces the \"OnBot Java\" Development Tool.  Similar to the FTC Blocks Development Tool, the FTC OnBot Java Development Tool allows a user to create, edit and build op modes dynamically using only a Javascript-enabled web browser.\n\nThe OnBot Java Development Tool is an integrated development environment (IDE) that is served up by the Robot Controller.  Op modes are created and edited using a Javascript-enabled browser (Google Chromse is recommended).  Op modes are saved on the Robot Controller Android device directly.\n\nThe OnBot Java Development Tool provides a Java programming environment that does NOT need Android Studio.\n\n\n\nChanges with version 3.2 include:\n * Enhanced web-based development tools\n    - Introduction of OnBot Java Development Tool.\n    - Web-based programming and management features are \"always on\" (user no longer needs to put Robot Controller into programming mode).\n    - Web-based management interface (where user can change Robot Controller name and also easily download Robot Controller log file).\n    - OnBot Java, Blocks and Management features available from web based interface.\n\n* Blocks Programming Development Tool:\n    - Changed \"LynxI2cColorRangeSensor\" block to \"REV Color/range sensor\" block.\n    - Fixed tooltip for ColorSensor.isLightOn block.\n    Added blocks for ColorSensor.getNormalizedColors and LynxI2cColorRangeSensor.getNormalizedColors.\n\n* Added example op modes for digital touch sensor and REV Robotics Color Distance sensor.\n* User selectable color themes.\n* Includes many minor enhancements and fixes (too numerous to list).\n\nKnown issues:\n* Auto complete function is incomplete and does not support the following (for now):\n     - Access via *this* keyword\n     - Access via *super* keyword\n     - Members of the super cloass, not overridden by the class\n     - Any methods provided in the current class\n     - Inner classes\n     - Can't handle casted objects\n     - Any objects coming from an parenthetically enclosed expression\n\n## Version 3.10 (built on 17.05.09)\n\nThis version of the software provides support for the REV Robotics Expansion Hub.  This version also includes improvements in the USB communication layer in an effort to enhance system resiliency.  If you were using a 2.x version of the software previously, updating to version 3.1 requires that you also update your Driver Station software in addition to updating the Robot Controller software.\n\nAlso note that in version 3.10 software, the setMaxSpeed and getMaxSpeed methods are no longer available (not deprecated, they have been removed from the SDK). Also note that the the new 3.x software incorporates motor profiles that a user can select as he/she configures the robot.\n\nChanges include:\n * Blocks changes\n    - Added VuforiaTrackableDefaultListener.getPose and Vuforia.trackPose blocks.\n    - Added optimized blocks support for Vuforia extended tracking.\n    - Added atan2 block to the math category.\n    - Added useCompetitionFieldTargetLocations parameter to Vuforia.initialize block.  If set to false, the target locations are placed at (0,0,0) with target orientation as specified in https://github.com/gearsincorg/FTCVuforiaDemo/blob/master/Robot_Navigation.java tutorial op mode.\n * Incorporates additional improvements to USB comm layer to improve system resiliency (to recover from a greater number of communication disruptions).\n\n**************************************************************************************\n\nAdditional Notes Regarding Version 3.00 (built on 17.04.13)\n\nIn addition to the release changes listed below (see section labeled \"Version 3.00 (built on 17.04.013)\"), version 3.00 has the following important changes:\n\n1. Version 3.00 software uses a new version of the FTC Robocol (robot protocol).  If you upgrade to v3.0 on the Robot Controller and/or Android Studio side, you must also upgrade the Driver Station software to match the new Robocol.\n2. Version 3.00 software removes the setMaxSpeed and getMaxSpeed methods from the DcMotor class.  If you have an op mode that formerly used these methods, you will need to remove the references/calls to these methods.  Instead, v3.0 provides the max speed information through the use of motor profiles that are selected by the user during robot configuration.\n3. Version 3.00 software currently does not have a mechanism to disable extra i2c sensors.  We hope to re-introduce this function with a release in the near future.\n\n**************************************************************************************\n\n## Version 3.00 (built on 17.04.13)\n\n*** Use this version of the software at YOUR OWN RISK!!! ***\n\nThis software is being released as an \"alpha\" version.

For example, if you have two motor controllers on a robot, and you misidentified them in your configuration file, you can use the Swap button to swap the devices within the configuration file (so you do not have to manually re-enter in the configuration info for the two devices).\n * Fix mechanism added to all user to replace an electronic module easily.  For example, suppose a servo controller dies on your robot. You replace the broken module with a new module, which has a different serial number from the original servo controller.  You can use the Fix button to automatically reconfigure your configuration file to use the serial number of the new module.\n * Improvements made to fix resiliency and responsiveness of the system.\n * For LinearOpMode the user now must for a telemetry.update() to update the telemetry data on the driver station.  This update() mechanism ensures that the driver station gets the updated data properly and at the same time.\n * The Auto Configure function of the Robot Controller is now template based.  If there is a commonly used robot configuration, a template can be created so that the Auto Configure mechanism can be used to quickly configure a robot of this type.\n * The logic to detect a runaway op mode (both in the LinearOpMode and OpMode types) and to abort the run, then auto recover has been improved/implemented.\n * Fix has been incorporated so that Logitech F310 gamepad mappings will be correct for Marshmallow users.\n\n## Release 16.07.08\n\n * For the ftc_app project, the gradle files have been modified to support Android Studio 2.1.x.\n\n## Release 16.03.30\n\n * For the MIT App Inventor, the design blocks have new icons that better represent the function of each design component.\n * Some changes were made to the shutdown logic to ensure the robust shutdown of some of our USB services.\n * A change was made to LinearOpMode so as to allow a given instance to be executed more than once, which is required for the App Inventor.\n * Javadoc improved/updated.\n\n## Release 16.03.09\n\n * Changes made to make the FTC SDK synchronous (significant change!)\n    - waitOneFullHardwareCycle() and waitForNextHardwareCycle() are no longer needed and have been deprecated.\n    - runOpMode() (for a LinearOpMode) is now decoupled from the system's hardware read/write thread.\n    - loop() (for an OpMode) is now decoupled from the system's hardware read/write thread.\n    - Methods are synchronous.\n    - For example, if you call setMode(DcMotorController.RunMode.RESET_ENCODERS) for a motor, the encoder is guaranteed to be reset when the method call is complete.\n    - For legacy module (NXT compatible), user no longer has to toggle between read and write modes when reading from or writing to a legacy device.\n * Changes made to enhance reliability/robustness during ESD event.\n * Changes made to make code thread safe.\n * Debug keystore added so that user-generated robot controller APKs will all use the same signed key (to avoid conflicts if a team has multiple developer laptops for example).\n * Firmware version information for Modern Robotics modules are now logged.\n * Changes made to improve USB comm reliability and robustness.\n * Added support for voltage indicator for legacy (NXT-compatible) motor controllers.\n * Changes made to provide auto stop capabilities for op modes.\n    - A LinearOpMode class will stop when the statements in runOpMode() are complete.  User does not have to push the stop button on the driver station.\n    - If an op mode is stopped by the driver station, but there is a run away/uninterruptible thread persisting, the app will log an error message then force itself to crash to stop the runaway thread.\n * Driver Station UI modified to display lowest measured voltage below current voltage (12V battery).\n * Driver Station UI modified to have color background for current voltage (green=good, yellow=caution, red=danger, extremely low voltage).\n * javadoc improved (edits and additional classes).\n * Added app build time to About activity for driver station and robot controller apps.\n * Display local IP addresses on Driver Station About activity.\n * Added I2cDeviceSynchImpl.\n * Added I2cDeviceSync interface.\n * Added seconds() and milliseconds() to ElapsedTime for clarity.\n * Added getCallbackCount() to I2cDevice.\n * Added missing clearI2cPortActionFlag.\n * Added code to create log messages while waiting for LinearOpMode shutdown.\n * Fix so Wifi Direct Config activity will no longer launch multiple times.\n * Added the ability to specify an alternate i2c address in software for the Modern Robotics gyro.\n\n## Release 16.02.09\n\n * Improved battery checker feature so that voltage values get refreshed regularly (every 250 msec) on Driver Station (DS) user interface.\n * Improved software so that Robot Controller (RC) is much more resilient and  self-healing  to USB disconnects:\n    - If user attempts to start/restart RC with one or more module missing, it will display a warning but still start up.\n    - When running an op mode, if one or more modules gets disconnected, the RC & DS will display warnings,and robot will keep on working in spite of the missing module(s).\n    - If a disconnected module gets physically reconnected the RC will auto detect the module and the user will regain control of the recently connected module.\n    - Warning messages are more helpful (identifies the type of module that s missing plus its USB serial number).\n * Code changes to fix the null gamepad reference when users try to reference the gamepads in the init() portion of their op mode.\n * NXT light sensor output is now properly scaled.  Note that teams might have to readjust their light threshold values in their op modes.\n * On DS user interface, gamepad icon for a driver will disappear if the matching gamepad is disconnected or if that gamepad gets designated as a different driver.\n * Robot Protocol (ROBOCOL) version number info is displayed in About screen on RC and DS apps.\n * Incorporated a display filter on pairing screen to filter out devices that don t use the  <TEAM NUMBER>-  format. This filter can be turned off to show all WiFi Direct devices.\n * Updated text in License file.\n * Fixed formatting error in OpticalDistanceSensor.toString().\n * Fixed issue on with a blank (  ) device name that would disrupt WiFi Direct Pairing.\n * Made a change so that the WiFi info and battery info can be displayed more quickly on the DS upon connecting to RC.\n * Improved javadoc generation.\n * Modified code to make it easier to support language localization in the future.\n\n## Release 16.01.04\n\n * Updated compileSdkVersion for apps\n * Prevent Wifi from entering power saving mode\n * removed unused import from driver station\n * Corrrected \"Dead zone\" joystick code.\n * LED.getDeviceName and .getConnectionInfo() return null\n * apps check for ROBOCOL_VERSION mismatch\n * Fix for Telemetry also has off-by-one errors in its data string sizing / short size limitations error\n * User telemetry output is sorted.\n * added formatting variants to DbgLog and RobotLog APIs\n * code modified to allow for a long list of op mode names.\n * changes to improve thread safety of RobocolDatagramSocket\n * Fix for \"missing hardware leaves robot controller disconnected from driver station\" error\n * fix for \"fast tapping of Init/Start causes problems\" (toast is now only instantiated on UI thread).\n * added some log statements for thread life cycle.\n * moved gamepad reset logic inside of initActiveOpMode() for robustness\n * changes made to mitigate risk of race conditions on public methods.\n * changes to try and flag when WiFi Direct name contains non-printable characters.\n * fix to correct race condition between .run() and .close() in ReadWriteRunnableStandard.\n * updated FTDI driver\n * made ReadWriteRunnableStanard interface public.\n * fixed off-by-one errors in Command constructor\n * moved specific hardware implmentations into their own package.\n * moved specific gamepad implemnatations to the hardware library.\n * changed LICENSE file to new BSD version.\n * fixed race condition when shutting down Modern Robotics USB devices.\n * methods in the ColorSensor classes have been synchronized.\n * corrected isBusy() status to reflect end of motion.\n * corrected \"back\" button keycode.\n * the notSupported() method of the GyroSensor class was changed to protected (it should not be public).\n\n## Release 15.11.04.001\n\n * Added Support for Modern Robotics Gyro.\n  -

      "releaseNotes": "## Version 6.0 (20200921-085816)\n\n### Important Notes\n* Version 6.0 is the minimum legal version for the Ultimate Goal season.\n* Version 5.5 was a moderately large off-season, August 2020, drop.  It's worth reviewing those release notes below also.\n* Version 5.5 and greater will not work on older Android 4.x and 5.x phones.  Users must upgrade to an approved Android 6.x device or newer.\n* The default PIDF values for REV motors have been reverted to the default PID values that were used in the 2018-2019 season\n    * This change was made because the 2018-2019 values turned out to work better for many mechanisms\n    * This brings the behavior of the REV motors in line with the behavior of all other motors\n    * If you prefer the 2019-2020 season's behavior for REV motors, here are the PIDF values that were in place, so that you can manually set them in your OpModes:  \n      <br>\n      **HD Hex motors (all gearboxes):**  \n      Velocity PIDF values: `P = 1.17`, `I = 0.117`, `F = 11.7`  \n      Position PIDF values: `P = 5.0`  \n      **Core Hex motor:**  \n      Velocity PIDF values: `P = 4.96`, `I = 0.496`, `F = 49.6`  \n      Position PIDF values: `P = 5.0`\n\n### New features\n* Includes TensorFlow inference model and sample op modes to detect Ultimate Goal Starter Stacks (four rings vs single ring stack).\n* Includes Vuforia Ultimate Goal vision targets and sample op modes.\n* Introduces a digital zoom feature for TensorFlow object detection (to detect objects more accurately at greater distances).\n* Adds configuration entry for the REV UltraPlanetary HD Hex motor\n\n### Enhancements\n* Adds setGain() and getGain() methods to the NormalizedColorSensor interface\n    * By setting the gain of a color sensor, you can adjust for different lighting conditions.\n      For example, if you detect lower color values than expected, you can increase the gain.\n    * The gain value is only applied to the argb() and getNormalizedColors() methods, not to the raw color methods.\n      The getNormalizedColors() method is recommended for ease-of-use and clarity, since argb() has to be converted.\n    * Updates SensorColor Java sample to demonstrate gain usage\n* Merges SensorREVColorDistance Java sample into SensorColor Java sample, which showcases best practices for all color sensors\n* Improves retrieving values from the REV Color Sensor V3\n    * Updates the normalization calculation of the RGB channels\n    * Improves the calculation of the alpha channel (can be used as an overall brightness indicator)\n    * Fixes the default sensor resolution, which caused issues with bright environments\n    * Adds support for changing the resolution and measuring rate of the Broadcom sensor chip\n    * Removes IR readings and calculations not meant for the Broadcom sensor chip\n\n### Bug fixes\n* Improved reliability of BNO055IMU IMU initialization to prevent random initialization failures (which manifested as `Problem with 'imu'`).\n\n## Version 5.5 (20200824-090813)\n\n### New features\n* Adds support for calling custom Java classes from Blocks OpModes (fixes [SkyStone issue #161](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SkyStone/issues/161)).\n    * Classes must be in the org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode package.\n    * Methods must be public static and have no more than 21 parameters.\n    * Parameters declared as OpMode, LinearOpMode, Telemetry, and HardwareMap are supported and the\n      argument is provided automatically, regardless of the order of the parameters. On the block,\n      the sockets for those parameters are automatically filled in.\n    * Parameters declared as char or java.lang.Character will accept any block that returns text\n      and will only use the first character in the text.\n    * Parameters declared as boolean or java.lang.Boolean will accept any block that returns boolean.\n    * Parameters declared as byte, java.lang.Byte, short, java.lang.Short, int, java.lang.Integer,\n      long, or java.lang.Long,  will accept any block that returns a number and will round that\n      value to the nearest whole number.\n    * Parameters declared as float, java.lang.Float, double, java.lang.Double will accept any\n      block that returns a number.\n* Adds telemetry API method for setting display format\n    * Classic\n    * Monospace\n    * HTML (certain tags only)\n* Adds blocks support for switching cameras.\n* Adds Blocks support for TensorFlow Object Detection with a custom model.\n* Adds support for uploading a custom TensorFlow Object Detection model in the Manage page, which\n  is especially useful for Blocks and OnBotJava users.\n* Shows new Control Hub blink codes when the WiFi band is switched using the Control Hub's button (only possible on Control Hub OS 1.1.2)\n* Adds new warnings which can be disabled in the Advanced RC Settings\n    * Mismatched app versions warning\n    * Unnecessary 2.4 GHz WiFi usage warning\n    * REV Hub is running outdated firmware (older than version 1.8.2)\n* Adds support for Sony PS4 gamepad, and reworks how gamepads work on the Driver Station\n    * Removes preference which sets gamepad type based on driver position. Replaced with menu which allows specifying type for gamepads with unknown VID and PID\n    * Attempts to auto-detect gamepad type based on USB VID and PID\n    * If gamepad VID and PID is not known, use type specified by user for that VID and PID\n    * If gamepad VID and PID is not known AND the user has not specified a type for that VID and PID, an educated guess is made about how to map the gamepad\n* Driver Station will now attempt to automatically recover from a gamepad disconnecting, and re-assign it to the position it was assigned to when it dropped\n    * If only one gamepad is assigned and it drops: it can be recovered\n    * If two gamepads are assigned, and have **different** VID/PID signatures, and only one drops: it will be recovered\n    * If two gamepads are assigned, and have **different** VID/PID signatures, and BOTH drop: both will be recovered\n    * If two gamepads are assigned, and have **the same** VID/PID signatures, and only one drops: it will be recovered\n    * If two gamepads are assigned, and have **the same** VID/PID signatures, and BOTH drop: **neither** will be recovered, because of the ambiguity of the gamepads when they re-appear on the USB bus.\n    * There is currently one known edge case: if there are **two** gamepads with **the same** VID/PID signature plugged in, **but only one is assigned**, and they BOTH drop, it's a 50-50 chance of which one will be chosen for automatic recovery to the assigned position: it is determined by whichever one is re-enumerated first by the USB bus controller.\n* Adds landscape user interface to Driver Station\n    * New feature: practice timer with audio cues\n    * New feature (Control Hub only): wireless network connection strength indicator (0-5 bars)\n    * New feature (Control Hub only): tapping on the ping/channel display will switch to an alternate display showing radio RX dBm and link speed (tap again to switch back)\n    * The layout will NOT autorotate. You can switch the layout from the Driver Station's settings menu.\n\n### Breaking changes\n* Removes support for Android versions 4.4 through 5.1 (KitKat and Lollipop). The minSdkVersion is now 23.\n* Removes the deprecated `LinearOpMode` methods `waitOneFullHardwareCycle()` and `waitForNextHardwareCycle()`\n\n### Enhancements\n* Handles RS485 address of Control Hub automatically\n    * The Control Hub is automatically given a reserved address\n    * Existing configuration files will continue to work\n    * All addresses in the range of 1-10 are still available for Expansion Hubs\n    * The Control Hub light will now normally be solid green, without blinking to indicate the address\n    * The Control Hub will not be shown on the Expansion Hub Address Change settings page\n* Improves REV Hub firmware updater\n    * The user can now choose between all available firmware update files\n    * Version 1.8.2 of the REV Hub firmware is bundled into the Robot Controller app.\n    * Text was added to clarify that Expansion Hubs can only be updated via USB.\n    * Firmware update speed was reduced to improve reliability\n    * Allows REV Hub firmware to be updated directly from the Manage webpage\n* Improves log viewer on Robot Controller\n    * Horizontal scrolling support (no longer word wrapped)\n    * Supports pinch-to-zoom\n    * Uses a monospaced font\n    * Error messages are highlighted\n    * New color scheme\n* Attempts to force-stop a runaway/stuck OpMode without restarting the entire app\n    * Not all types of runaway conditions are stoppable, but if the user code attempts to talk to hardware during the runaway, the system should be able to capture it.\n* Makes various tweaks to the Self Inspect screen\n    * Renames \"OS version\" entry to \"Android version\"\n    * Renames \"WiFi Direct Name\" to \"WiFi Name\"\n    * Adds Control Hub OS version, when viewing the report of a Control Hub\n    * Hides the airplane mode entry, when viewing the report of a Control Hub\n    * Removes check for ZTE Speed Channel Changer\n    * Shows firmware version for **all** Expansion and Control Hubs\n* Reworks network settings portion of Manage page\n    * All network settings are now applied with a single click\n    * The WiFi Direct channel of phone-based Robot Controllers can now be changed from the Manage page\n    * WiFi channels are filtered by band (2.4 vs 5 GHz) and whether they overlap with other channels\n    * The current WiFi channel is pre-selected on phone-based Robot Controllers, and Control Hubs running OS 1.1.2 or later.\n    * On Control Hubs running OS 1.1.2 or later, you can choose to have the system automatically select a channel on the 5 GHz band\n* Improves OnBotJava\n    * New light and dark themes replace the old themes (chaos, github, chrome,...)\n        * the new default theme is `light` and will be used when you first update to this version\n    * OnBotJava now has a tabbed editor\n    * Read-only offline mode\n* Improves function of \"exit\" menu item on Robot Controller and Driver Station\n    * Now guaranteed to be fully stopped and unloaded from memory\n* Shows a warning message if a LinearOpMode exists prematurely due to failure to monitor for the start condition\n* Improves error message shown when the Driver Station and Robot Controller are incompatible with each other\n* Driver Station OpMode Control Panel now disabled while a Restart Robot is in progress\n* Disables advanced settings related to WiFi direct when the Robot Controller is a Control Hub.\n* Tint phone battery icons on Driver Station when low/critical.\n* Uses names \"Control Hub Portal\" and \"Control Hub\" (when appropriate) in new configuration files\n* Improve I2C read performance\n    * Very large improvement on Control Hub; up to ~2x faster with small (e.g. 6 byte) reads\n    * Not as apparent on Expansion Hubs connected to a phone\n* Update/refresh build infrastructure\n    * Update to 'androidx' support library from 'com.android.support:appcompat', which is end-of-life\n    * Update targetSdkVersion and compileSdkVersion to 28\n    * Update Android Studio's Android plugin to latest\n    * Fix reported build timestamp in 'About' screen\n* Add sample illustrating manual webcam use: ConceptWebcam\n\n\n### Bug fixes\n* Fixes [SkyStone issue #248](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SkyStone/issues/248)\n* Fixes [SkyStone issue #232](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SkyStone/issues/232) and\n  modifies bulk caching semantics to allow for cache-preserving MANUAL/AUTO transitions.\n* Improves performance when REV 2M distance sensor is unplugged\n* Improves readability of Toast messages on certain devices\n* Allows a Driver Station to connect to a Robot Controller after another has disconnected\n* Improves generation of fake serial numbers for UVC cameras which do not provide a real serial number\n    * Previously some devices would assign such cameras a serial of `0:0` and fail to open and start streaming\n    * Fixes [ftc_app issue #638](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/issues/638).\n* Fixes a slew of bugs with the Vuforia camera monitor including:\n    * Fixes bug where preview could be displayed with a wonky aspect ratio\n    * Fixes bug where preview could be cut off in landscape\n    * Fixes bug where preview got totally messed up when rotating phone\n    * Fixes bug where crosshair could drift off target when using webcams\n* Fixes issue in UVC driver on some devices ([ftc_app 681](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/issues/681)) if streaming was started/stopped multiple times in a row\n    * Issue manifested as kernel panic on devices which do not have [this kernel patch](https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/352400/).\n    * On affected devices which **do** have the patch, the issue was manifest as simply a failure to start streaming.\n    * The Tech Team believes that the root cause of the issue is a bug in the Linux kernel XHCI driver. A workaround was implemented in the SDK UVC driver.\n* Fixes bug in UVC driver where often half the frames from the camera would be dropped (e.g. only 15FPS delivered during a streaming session configured for 30FPS).\n* Fixes issue where TensorFlow Object Detection would show results whose confidence was lower than\n  the minimum confidence parameter.\n* Fixes a potential exploitation issue of [CVE-2019-11358](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2019-11358/) in OnBotJava\n* Fixes changing the address of an Expansion Hub with additional Expansion Hubs connected to it\n* Preserves the Control Hub's network connection when \"Restart Robot\" is selected\n* Fixes issue where device scans would fail while the Robot was restarting\n* Fix RenderScript usage\n    * Use androidx.renderscript variant: increased compatibility\n    * Use RenderScript in Java mode, not native: simplifies build\n* Fixes webcam-frame-to-bitmap conversion problem: alpha channel wasn't being initialized, only R, G, & B\n* Fixes possible arithmetic overflow in Deadline\n* Fixes deadlock in Vuforia webcam support which could cause 5-second delays when stopping OpMode\n\n## Version 5.4 (20200108-101156)\n* Fixes [SkyStone issue #88](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SkyStone/issues/88)\n* Adds an inspection item that notes when a robot controller (Control Hub) is using the factory default password.\n* Fixes [SkyStone issue #61](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SkyStone/issues/61)\n* Fixes [SkyStone issue #142](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SkyStone/issues/142)\n* Fixes [ftc_app issue #417](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/issues/417) by adding more current and voltage monitoring capabilities for REV Hubs.\n* Fixes [a crash sometimes caused by OnBotJava activity](https://ftcforum.firstinspires.org/forum/ftc-technology/76217-onbotjava-crashes-robot-controller)\n* Improves OnBotJava autosave functionality [ftc_app #738](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/issues/738)\n* Fixes system responsiveness issue when an Expansion Hub is disconnected\n* Fixes issue where IMU initialization could prevent Op Modes from stopping\n* Fixes issue where AndroidTextToSpeech.speak() would fail if it was called too early\n* Adds telemetry.speak() methods and blocks, which cause the Driver Station (if also updated) to speak text\n* Adds and improves Expansion Hub-related warnings\n    * Improves Expansion Hub low battery warning\n        * Displays the warning immediately after the hub reports it\n        * Specifies whether the condition is current or occurred temporarily during an OpMode run\n        * Displays which hubs reported low battery\n    * Displays warning when hub loses and regains power during an OpMode run\n        * Fixes the hub's LED pattern after this condition\n    * Displays warning when Expansion Hub is not responding to commands\n        * Specifies whether the condition is current or occurred temporarily during an OpMode run\n    * Clarifies warning when Expansion Hub is not present at startup\n        * Specifies that this condition requires a Robot Restart before the hub can be used.\n        * The hub light will now accurately reflect this state\n    * Improves logging and reduces log spam during these conditions\n* Syncs the Control Hub time and timezone to a connected web browser programming the robot, if a Driver Station is not available.\n* Adds bulk read functionality for REV Hubs\n  * A bulk caching mode must be set at the Hub level with `LynxModule#setBulkCachingMode()`. This applies to all relevant SDK hardware classes that reference that Hub.\n  * The following following Hub bulk caching modes are available:\n    * `BulkCachingMode.OFF` (default): All hardware calls operate as usual. Bulk data can read through `LynxModule#getBulkData()` and processed manually.\n    * `BulkCachingMode.AUTO`: Applicable hardware calls are served from a bulk read cache that is cleared/refreshed automatically to ensure identical commands don't hit the same cache. The cache can also be cleared manually with `LynxModule#clearBulkCache()`, although this is not recommended.\n    * (advanced users) `BulkCachingMode.MANUAL`: Same as `BulkCachingMode.AUTO` except the cache is never cleared automatically. To avoid getting stale data, the cache must be manually cleared at the beginning of each loop body or as the user deems appropriate.\n* Removes PIDF Annotation values added in Rev 5.3 (to AndyMark, goBILDA and TETRIX motor configurations).\n  * The new motor types will still be available but their Default control behavior will revert back to Rev 5.2\n* Adds new `ConceptMotorBulkRead` sample Opmode to demonstrate and compare Motor Bulk-Read modes for reducing I/O latencies.\n\n## Version 5.3 (20191004-112306)\n* Fixes external USB/UVC webcam support\n* Makes various bugfixes and improvements to Blocks page, including but not limited to:\n    * Many visual tweaks\n    * Browser zoom and window resize behave better\n    * Resizing the Java preview pane works better and more consistently across browsers\n    * The Java preview pane consistently gets scrollbars when needed\n    * The Java preview pane is hidden by default on phones\n    * Internet Explorer 11 should work\n    * Large dropdown lists display properly on lower res screens\n    * Disabled buttons are now visually identifiable as disabled\n    * A warning is shown if a user selects a TFOD sample, but their device is not compatible\n    * Warning messages in a Blocks op mode are now visible by default.\n* Adds goBILDA 5201 and 5202 motors to Robot Configurator\n* Adds PIDF Annotation values to AndyMark, goBILDA and TETRIX motor configurations.\n    This has the effect of causing the RUN_USING_ENCODERS and RUN_TO_POSITION modes to use\n    PIDF vs PID closed loop control on these motors.  This should provide more responsive, yet stable, speed control.\n    PIDF adds Feedforward control to the basic PID control loop.\n    Feedforward is useful when controlling a motor's speed because it \"anticipates\" how much the control voltage\n    must change to achieve a new speed set-point, rather than requiring the integrated error to change sufficiently.\n    The PIDF values were chosen to provide responsive, yet stable, speed control on a lightly loaded motor.\n    The more heavily a motor is loaded (drag or friction), the more noticable the PIDF improvement will be.\n* Fixes startup crash on Android 10\n* Fixes [ftc_app issue #712](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/issues/712) (thanks to FROGbots-4634)\n* Fixes [ftc_app issue #542](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/issues/542)\n* Allows \"A\" and lowercase letters when naming device through RC and DS apps.\n\n## Version 5.2 (20190905-083277)\n* Fixes extra-wide margins on settings activities, and placement of the new configuration button\n* Adds Skystone Vuforia image target data.\n   * Includes sample Skystone Vuforia Navigation op modes (Java).\n   * Includes sample Skystone Vuforia Navigation op modes (Blocks).\n* Adds TensorFlow inference model (.tflite) for Skystone game elements.\n   * Includes sample Skystone TensorFlow op modes (Java).\n   * Includes sample Skystone TensorFlow op modes (Blocks).\n* Removes older (season-specific) sample op modes.\n* Includes 64-bit support (to comply with [Google Play requirements](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/01/get-your-apps-ready-for-64-bit.html)).\n* Protects against Stuck OpModes when a Restart Robot is requested. (Thanks to FROGbots-4634) ([ftc_app issue #709](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/issues/709))\n* Blocks related changes:\n   * Fixes bug with blocks generated code when hardware device name is a java or javascript reserved word.\n   * Shows generated java code for blocks, even when hardware items are missing from the active configuration.\n   * Displays warning icon when outdated Vuforia and TensorFlow blocks are used ([SkyStone issue #27](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SkyStone/issues/27))\n\n## Version 5.1 (20190820-222104)\n* Defines default PIDF parameters for the following motors:\n    * REV Core Hex Motor\n    * REV 20:1 HD Hex Motor\n    * REV 40:1 HD Hex Motor\n* Adds back button when running on a device without a system back button (such as a Control Hub)\n* Allows a REV Control Hub to update the firmware on a REV Expansion Hub via USB\n* Fixes [SkyStone issue #9](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SkyStone/issues/9)\n* Fixes [ftc_app issue #715](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/issues/715)\n* Prevents extra DS User clicks by filtering based on current state.\n* Prevents incorrect DS UI state changes when receiving new OpMode list from RC\n* Adds support for REV Color Sensor V3\n* Adds a manual-refresh DS Camera Stream for remotely viewing RC camera frames.\n    * To show the stream on the DS, initialize **but do not run** a stream-enabled opmode, select the Camera Stream option in the DS menu, and tap the image to refresh. This feature is automatically enabled when using Vuforia or TFOD no additional RC configuration is required for typical use cases. To hide the stream, select the same menu item again.\n    * Note that gamepads are disabled and the selected opmode cannot be started while the stream is open as a safety precaution.\n    * To use custom streams, consult the API docs for `CameraStreamServer#setSource` and `CameraStreamSource`.\n* Adds many Star Wars sounds to RobotController resources.\n* Added Skystone Sounds Chooser Sample Program.\n* Switches out startup, connect chimes, and error/warning sounds for Star Wars sounds\n* Updates OnBot Java to use a WebSocket for communication with the robot\n    * The OnBot Java page no longer has to do a full refresh when a user switches from editing one file to another\n\nKnown issues:\n* Camera Stream\n    * The Vuforia camera stream inherits the issues present in the phone preview (namely [ftc_app issue #574](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/issues/574)). This problem does not affect the TFOD camera stream even though it receives frames from Vuforia.\n    * The orientation of the stream frames may not always match the phone preview. For now, these frames may be rotated manually via a custom `CameraStreamSource` if desired.\n* OnBotJava\n    * Browser back button may not always work correctly\n    * It's possible for a build to be queued, but not started. The OnBot Java build console will display a warning if this occurs.\n    * A user might not realize they are editing a different file if the user inadvertently switches from one file to another since this switch is now seamless.

If UVC camera has a unique serial number, RC will detect and enumerate by serial number.\n    - If UVC camera lacks a unique serial number, RC will only support one camera of that type connected.\n    - Calibration settings for a few cameras are included (see TeamCode/src/main/res/xml/teamwebcamcalibrations.xml for details).\n    - User can upload calibration files from Program and Manage web interface.\n    - UVC cameras seem to draw a fair amount of electrical current from the USB bus.\n         + This does not appear to present any problems for the REV Robotics Control Hub.\n\t + This does seem to create stability problems when using some cameras with an Android phone-based Robot Controller.\n\t + FTC Tech Team is investigating options to mitigate this issue with the phone-based Robot Controllers.\n    - Updated sample Vuforia Navigation and VuMark Op Modes to demonstrate how to use an internal phone-based camera and an external UVC webcam.\n\n * Support for improved motor control.\n    - REV Robotics Expansion Hub firmware 1.8 and greater will support a feed forward mechanism for closed loop motor control.\n    -

Changes to make the system more robust during the firmware update process (when performed through Robot Controller app).\n    - User no longer has to disconnect a downstream daisy-chained Expansion Hub when updating an Expansion Hub's firmware.\n        + If user is updating an Expansion Hub's firmware through a USB connection, he/she does not have to disconnect RS485 connection to other Expansion Hubs.\n\t+ The user still must use a USB connection to update an Expansion Hub's firmware.\n\t+ The user cannot update the Expansion Hub firmware for a downstream device that is daisy chained through an RS485 connection.\n    - If an Expansion Hub accidentally gets \"bricked\" the Robot Controller app is now more likely to recognize the Hub when it scans the USB bus.\n        + Robot Controller app should be able to detect an Expansion Hub, even if it accidentally was bricked in a previous update attempt.\n\t+ Robot Controller app should be able to install the firmware onto the Hub, even if if accidentally was bricked in a previous update attempt.\n\n * Resiliency\n    - FTC software can detect and enable an FTDI reset feature that is available with REV Robotics v1.8 Expansion Hub firmware and greater.\n        + When enabled, the Expansion Hub can detect if it hasn't communicated with the Robot Controller over the FTDI (USB) connection.\n\t+ If the Hub hasn't heard from the Robot Controller in a while, it will reset the FTDI connection.\n\t+ This action helps system recover from some ESD-induced disruptions.\n    - Various fixes to improve reliability of FTC software.\n\n * Blocks\n    - Fixed errors with string and list indices in blocks export to java.\n    - Support for USB connected UVC webcams.\n    - Refactored optimized Blocks Vuforia code to support Rover Ruckus image targets.\n    -

Renamed I2cSensorType to I2cDeviceType.\n    - Added an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates localization using 2018-2019 (Rover Ruckus presented by QualComm) Vuforia targets.\n    - Added an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates how to use the REV Robotics 2m Laser Distance Sensor.\n    - Added an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates how to use the REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller.\n    - Re-categorized external Java sample Op Modes to \"TeleOp\" instead of \"Autonomous\".\n\nKnown issues:\n * Initial support for UVC compatible cameras\n    - UVC cameras seem to draw significant amount of current from the USB bus.\n        + This does not appear to present any problems for the REV Robotics Control Hub.\n\t+ This does seem to create stability problems when using some cameras with an Android phone-based Robot Controller.\n\t+ FTC Tech Team is investigating options to mitigate this issue with the phone-based Robot Controllers.\n    - There might be a possible deadlock which causes the RC to become unresponsive when using a UVC webcam with a Nougat Android Robot Controller.\n\n * Wireless\n    - When user selects a wireless channel, this channel does not necessarily persist if the phone is power cycled.\n        + Tech Team is hoping to eventually address this issue in a future release.\n\t+ Issue has been present since apps were introduced (i.e., it is not new with the v4.0 release).\n    - Wireless channel is not currently displayed for WiFi Direct connections.\n\n * Miscellaneous\n    - The blink indication feature that shows which Expansion Hub is currently being configured does not work for a newly created configuration file.\n        + User has to first save a newly created configuration file and then close and re-edit the file in order for blink indicator to work.\n\n## Version 3.6 (built on 17.12.18)\n\nChanges include:\n * Blocks Changes\n     - Uses updated Google Blockly software to allow users to edit their op modes on Apple iOS devices (including iPad and iPhone).\n     - Improvement in Blocks tool to handle corrupt op mode files.\n     - Autonomous op modes should no longer get switched back to tele-op after re-opening them to be edited.\n     - The system can now detect type mismatches during runtime and alert the user with a message on the Driver Station.\n * Updated javadoc documentation for setPower() method to reflect correct range of values (-1 to +1).\n * Modified VuforiaLocalizerImpl to allow for user rendering of frames\n     - Added a user-overrideable onRenderFrame() method which gets called by the class's renderFrame() method.\n\n## Version 3.5 (built on 17.10.30)\n\nChanges with version 3.5 include:\n * Introduced a fix to prevent random op mode stops, which can occur after the Robot Controller app has been paused and then resumed (for example, when a user temporarily turns off the display of the Robot Controller phone, and then turns the screen back on).\n * Introduced a fix to prevent random op mode stops, which were previously caused by random peer disconnect events on the Driver Station.\n * Fixes issue where log files would be closed on pause of the RC or DS, but not re-opened upon resume.\n * Fixes issue with battery handler (voltage) start/stop race.\n * Fixes issue where Android Studio generated op modes would disappear from available list in certain situations.\n * Fixes problem where OnBot Java would not build on REV Robotics Control Hub.\n * Fixes problem where OnBot Java would not build if the date and time on the Robot Controller device was \"rewound\" (set to an earlier date/time).\n * Improved error message on OnBot Java that occurs when renaming a file fails.\n * Removed unneeded resources from android.jar binaries used by OnBot Java to reduce final size of Robot Controller app.\n * Added MR_ANALOG_TOUCH_SENSOR block to Blocks Programming Tool.\n\n## Version 3.4 (built on 17.09.06)\n\nChanges with version 3.4 include:\n * Added telemetry.update() statement for BlankLinearOpMode template.\n * Renamed sample Block op modes to be more consistent with Java samples.\n * Added some additional sample Block op modes.\n * Reworded OnBot Java readme slightly.\n\n## Version 3.3 (built on 17.09.04)\n\nThis version of the software includes improves for the FTC Blocks Programming Tool and the OnBot Java Programming Tool.\n\nChanges with verion 3.3 include:\n * Android Studio ftc_app project has been updated to use Gradle Plugin 2.3.3.\n * Android Studio ftc_app project is already using gradle 3.5 distribution.\n * Robot Controller log has been renamed to /sdcard/RobotControllerLog.txt (note that this change was actually introduced w/ v3.2).\n * Improvements in I2C reliability.\n * Optimized I2C read for REV Expansion Hub, with v1.7 firmware or greater.\n * Updated all external/samples (available through OnBot and in Android project folder).\n * Vuforia\n    -

Updated (and more useful) onBot welcome message.\n\nKnown issues:\n * Android Studio\n    - After updating to the new v3.3 Android Studio project folder, if you get error messages indicating \"InvalidVirtualFileAccessException\" then you might need to do a File->Invalidate Caches / Restart to clear the error.\n * OnBot Java\n    - Sometimes when you push the build button to build all op modes, the RC returns an error message that the build failed.  If you press the build button a second time, the build typically suceeds.\n\n## Version 3.2 (built on 17.08.02)\n\nThis version of the software introduces the \"OnBot Java\" Development Tool.  Similar to the FTC Blocks Development Tool, the FTC OnBot Java Development Tool allows a user to create, edit and build op modes dynamically using only a Javascript-enabled web browser.\n\nThe OnBot Java Development Tool is an integrated development environment (IDE) that is served up by the Robot Controller.  Op modes are created and edited using a Javascript-enabled browser (Google Chromse is recommended).  Op modes are saved on the Robot Controller Android device directly.\n\nThe OnBot Java Development Tool provides a Java programming environment that does NOT need Android Studio.\n\n\n\nChanges with version 3.2 include:\n * Enhanced web-based development tools\n    - Introduction of OnBot Java Development Tool.\n    - Web-based programming and management features are \"always on\" (user no longer needs to put Robot Controller into programming mode).\n    - Web-based management interface (where user can change Robot Controller name and also easily download Robot Controller log file).\n    - OnBot Java, Blocks and Management features available from web based interface.\n\n* Blocks Programming Development Tool:\n    - Changed \"LynxI2cColorRangeSensor\" block to \"REV Color/range sensor\" block.\n    - Fixed tooltip for ColorSensor.isLightOn block.\n    Added blocks for ColorSensor.getNormalizedColors and LynxI2cColorRangeSensor.getNormalizedColors.\n\n* Added example op modes for digital touch sensor and REV Robotics Color Distance sensor.\n* User selectable color themes.\n* Includes many minor enhancements and fixes (too numerous to list).\n\nKnown issues:\n* Auto complete function is incomplete and does not support the following (for now):\n     - Access via *this* keyword\n     - Access via *super* keyword\n     - Members of the super cloass, not overridden by the class\n     - Any methods provided in the current class\n     - Inner classes\n     - Can't handle casted objects\n     - Any objects coming from an parenthetically enclosed expression\n\n## Version 3.10 (built on 17.05.09)\n\nThis version of the software provides support for the REV Robotics Expansion Hub.  This version also includes improvements in the USB communication layer in an effort to enhance system resiliency.  If you were using a 2.x version of the software previously, updating to version 3.1 requires that you also update your Driver Station software in addition to updating the Robot Controller software.\n\nAlso note that in version 3.10 software, the setMaxSpeed and getMaxSpeed methods are no longer available (not deprecated, they have been removed from the SDK). Also note that the the new 3.x software incorporates motor profiles that a user can select as he/she configures the robot.\n\nChanges include:\n * Blocks changes\n    - Added VuforiaTrackableDefaultListener.getPose and Vuforia.trackPose blocks.\n    - Added optimized blocks support for Vuforia extended tracking.\n    - Added atan2 block to the math category.\n    - Added useCompetitionFieldTargetLocations parameter to Vuforia.initialize block.  If set to false, the target locations are placed at (0,0,0) with target orientation as specified in https://github.com/gearsincorg/FTCVuforiaDemo/blob/master/Robot_Navigation.java tutorial op mode.\n * Incorporates additional improvements to USB comm layer to improve system resiliency (to recover from a greater number of communication disruptions).\n\n**************************************************************************************\n\nAdditional Notes Regarding Version 3.00 (built on 17.04.13)\n\nIn addition to the release changes listed below (see section labeled \"Version 3.00 (built on 17.04.013)\"), version 3.00 has the following important changes:\n\n1. Version 3.00 software uses a new version of the FTC Robocol (robot protocol).  If you upgrade to v3.0 on the Robot Controller and/or Android Studio side, you must also upgrade the Driver Station software to match the new Robocol.\n2. Version 3.00 software removes the setMaxSpeed and getMaxSpeed methods from the DcMotor class.  If you have an op mode that formerly used these methods, you will need to remove the references/calls to these methods.  Instead, v3.0 provides the max speed information through the use of motor profiles that are selected by the user during robot configuration.\n3. Version 3.00 software currently does not have a mechanism to disable extra i2c sensors.  We hope to re-introduce this function with a release in the near future.\n\n**************************************************************************************\n\n## Version 3.00 (built on 17.04.13)\n\n*** Use this version of the software at YOUR OWN RISK!!! ***\n\nThis software is being released as an \"alpha\" version.

This is important - we no longer set the motor modes through the motor controller.\n * setMode and getMode were added to the DcMotor class.\n * ContinuousRotationServo class has been added to the FTC SDK.\n * Range.clip() method has been overloaded so it can support this operation for int, short and byte integers.\n * Some changes have been made (new methods added) on how a user can access items from the hardware map.\n * Users can now set the zero power behavior for a DC motor so that the motor will brake or float when power is zero.\n * Prototype Blockly Programming Mode has been added to FTC Robot Controller.  Users can place the Robot Controller into this mode, and then use a device (such as a laptop) that has a Javascript enabled browser to write Blockly-based Op Modes directly onto the Robot Controller.\n * Users can now configure the robot remotely through the FTC Driver Station app.\n * Android Studio project supports Android Studio 2.1.x and compile SDK Version 23 (Marshmallow).\n * Vuforia Computer Vision SDK integrated into FTC SDK.

For example, if you have two motor controllers on a robot, and you misidentified them in your configuration file, you can use the Swap button to swap the devices within the configuration file (so you do not have to manually re-enter in the configuration info for the two devices).\n * Fix mechanism added to all user to replace an electronic module easily.  For example, suppose a servo controller dies on your robot. You replace the broken module with a new module, which has a different serial number from the original servo controller.  You can use the Fix button to automatically reconfigure your configuration file to use the serial number of the new module.\n * Improvements made to fix resiliency and responsiveness of the system.\n * For LinearOpMode the user now must for a telemetry.update() to update the telemetry data on the driver station.  This update() mechanism ensures that the driver station gets the updated data properly and at the same time.\n * The Auto Configure function of the Robot Controller is now template based.  If there is a commonly used robot configuration, a template can be created so that the Auto Configure mechanism can be used to quickly configure a robot of this type.\n * The logic to detect a runaway op mode (both in the LinearOpMode and OpMode types) and to abort the run, then auto recover has been improved/implemented.\n * Fix has been incorporated so that Logitech F310 gamepad mappings will be correct for Marshmallow users.\n\n## Release 16.07.08\n\n * For the ftc_app project, the gradle files have been modified to support Android Studio 2.1.x.\n\n## Release 16.03.30\n\n * For the MIT App Inventor, the design blocks have new icons that better represent the function of each design component.\n * Some changes were made to the shutdown logic to ensure the robust shutdown of some of our USB services.\n * A change was made to LinearOpMode so as to allow a given instance to be executed more than once, which is required for the App Inventor.\n * Javadoc improved/updated.\n\n## Release 16.03.09\n\n * Changes made to make the FTC SDK synchronous (significant change!)\n    - waitOneFullHardwareCycle() and waitForNextHardwareCycle() are no longer needed and have been deprecated.\n    - runOpMode() (for a LinearOpMode) is now decoupled from the system's hardware read/write thread.\n    - loop() (for an OpMode) is now decoupled from the system's hardware read/write thread.\n    - Methods are synchronous.\n    - For example, if you call setMode(DcMotorController.RunMode.RESET_ENCODERS) for a motor, the encoder is guaranteed to be reset when the method call is complete.\n    - For legacy module (NXT compatible), user no longer has to toggle between read and write modes when reading from or writing to a legacy device.\n * Changes made to enhance reliability/robustness during ESD event.\n * Changes made to make code thread safe.\n * Debug keystore added so that user-generated robot controller APKs will all use the same signed key (to avoid conflicts if a team has multiple developer laptops for example).\n * Firmware version information for Modern Robotics modules are now logged.\n * Changes made to improve USB comm reliability and robustness.\n * Added support for voltage indicator for legacy (NXT-compatible) motor controllers.\n * Changes made to provide auto stop capabilities for op modes.\n    - A LinearOpMode class will stop when the statements in runOpMode() are complete.  User does not have to push the stop button on the driver station.\n    - If an op mode is stopped by the driver station, but there is a run away/uninterruptible thread persisting, the app will log an error message then force itself to crash to stop the runaway thread.\n * Driver Station UI modified to display lowest measured voltage below current voltage (12V battery).\n * Driver Station UI modified to have color background for current voltage (green=good, yellow=caution, red=danger, extremely low voltage).\n * javadoc improved (edits and additional classes).\n * Added app build time to About activity for driver station and robot controller apps.\n * Display local IP addresses on Driver Station About activity.\n * Added I2cDeviceSynchImpl.\n * Added I2cDeviceSync interface.\n * Added seconds() and milliseconds() to ElapsedTime for clarity.\n * Added getCallbackCount() to I2cDevice.\n * Added missing clearI2cPortActionFlag.\n * Added code to create log messages while waiting for LinearOpMode shutdown.\n * Fix so Wifi Direct Config activity will no longer launch multiple times.\n * Added the ability to specify an alternate i2c address in software for the Modern Robotics gyro.\n\n## Release 16.02.09\n\n * Improved battery checker feature so that voltage values get refreshed regularly (every 250 msec) on Driver Station (DS) user interface.\n * Improved software so that Robot Controller (RC) is much more resilient and  self-healing  to USB disconnects:\n    - If user attempts to start/restart RC with one or more module missing, it will display a warning but still start up.\n    - When running an op mode, if one or more modules gets disconnected, the RC & DS will display warnings,and robot will keep on working in spite of the missing module(s).\n    - If a disconnected module gets physically reconnected the RC will auto detect the module and the user will regain control of the recently connected module.\n    - Warning messages are more helpful (identifies the type of module that s missing plus its USB serial number).\n * Code changes to fix the null gamepad reference when users try to reference the gamepads in the init() portion of their op mode.\n * NXT light sensor output is now properly scaled.  Note that teams might have to readjust their light threshold values in their op modes.\n * On DS user interface, gamepad icon for a driver will disappear if the matching gamepad is disconnected or if that gamepad gets designated as a different driver.\n * Robot Protocol (ROBOCOL) version number info is displayed in About screen on RC and DS apps.\n * Incorporated a display filter on pairing screen to filter out devices that don t use the  <TEAM NUMBER>-  format. This filter can be turned off to show all WiFi Direct devices.\n * Updated text in License file.\n * Fixed formatting error in OpticalDistanceSensor.toString().\n * Fixed issue on with a blank (  ) device name that would disrupt WiFi Direct Pairing.\n * Made a change so that the WiFi info and battery info can be displayed more quickly on the DS upon connecting to RC.\n * Improved javadoc generation.\n * Modified code to make it easier to support language localization in the future.\n\n## Release 16.01.04\n\n * Updated compileSdkVersion for apps\n * Prevent Wifi from entering power saving mode\n * removed unused import from driver station\n * Corrrected \"Dead zone\" joystick code.\n * LED.getDeviceName and .getConnectionInfo() return null\n * apps check for ROBOCOL_VERSION mismatch\n * Fix for Telemetry also has off-by-one errors in its data string sizing / short size limitations error\n * User telemetry output is sorted.\n * added formatting variants to DbgLog and RobotLog APIs\n * code modified to allow for a long list of op mode names.\n * changes to improve thread safety of RobocolDatagramSocket\n * Fix for \"missing hardware leaves robot controller disconnected from driver station\" error\n * fix for \"fast tapping of Init/Start causes problems\" (toast is now only instantiated on UI thread).\n * added some log statements for thread life cycle.\n * moved gamepad reset logic inside of initActiveOpMode() for robustness\n * changes made to mitigate risk of race conditions on public methods.\n * changes to try and flag when WiFi Direct name contains non-printable characters.\n * fix to correct race condition between .run() and .close() in ReadWriteRunnableStandard.\n * updated FTDI driver\n * made ReadWriteRunnableStanard interface public.\n * fixed off-by-one errors in Command constructor\n * moved specific hardware implmentations into their own package.\n * moved specific gamepad implemnatations to the hardware library.\n * changed LICENSE file to new BSD version.\n * fixed race condition when shutting down Modern Robotics USB devices.\n * methods in the ColorSensor classes have been synchronized.\n * corrected isBusy() status to reflect end of motion.\n * corrected \"back\" button keycode.\n * the notSupported() method of the GyroSensor class was changed to protected (it should not be public).\n\n## Release 15.11.04.001\n\n * Added Support for Modern Robotics Gyro.\n  - The GyroSensor class now supports the MR Gyro Sensor.\n  - Users can access heading data (about Z axis)\n  - Users can also access raw gyro data (X, Y, & Z axes).\n  - Example MRGyroTest.java op mode included.\n * Improved error messages\n  - More descriptive error messages for exceptions in user code.\n * Updated DcMotor API\n * Enable read mode on new address in setI2cAddress\n * Fix so that driver station app resets the gamepads when switching op modes.\n * USB-related code changes to make USB comm more responsive and to display more explicit error messages.\n  -
